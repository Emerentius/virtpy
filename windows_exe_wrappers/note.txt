The files in this folder are the same that pip uses to create exe wrappers for python
scripts.
They were taken from pip's vendored copy of the distlib module in pip's git repo
(commit hash f81cfff06120a0c63945d36ad75229f137b3a245)
which is somewhere around version 20.2.4.

The launcher code is available at https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/simple_launcher/.

To create a wrapper, you only need to concatenate one of these launchers with a shebang
and a zip of the code to be executed.
